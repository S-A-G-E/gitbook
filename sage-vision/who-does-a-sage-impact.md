# Who does a S.A.G.E. impact?

### Who benefits from a S.A.G.E.?

 Personal credentials benefit both learners and societies by providing ways for employers to verify job skills, as well as recognition on an individual level. Earned educational assets forwarded to each employer, added to resumes, chosen to be displayed otherwise or used to further educational careers or paths allow for a dynamically distributed system that's far more fluid than the current network.

 Heavily indebted poor countries\(H.I.P.C.'s\) and lower-income individuals benefit the most from this type of system as it allows for a broader reach of education in areas that are subjective to more poverty and harsh conditions. Older individuals and people with established careers and jobs benefit significantly from this system as it is dynamic and capable of adapting to new standards and proposals.
