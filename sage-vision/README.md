## Vision of the S.A.G.E.

### Mission Statement

Our mission is to establish a **S.A.G.E.**â€” **S**ystem of **A**utonomous **G**lobal **E**ducation.   
  
 The development and style of the software/program in mind will be open-source, decentralized and distributed by a peer-to-peer network. This type of system would allow for a very dynamic educational system that is capable of fluctuating with economic incentives, learning biases and informational changes that occur through advances such as;

* Invention
* Innovation
* Discovery

 A global network of organized, secure and verifiable information creates a convenient method for educational based processes to be distributed, safe & practical.   
  
 Many levels of inputs are acceptableâ€” a change in the core values surrounding the projects by outsider opinions and influences is near impossible. The vision of the S.A.G.E. cannot be summed up better than this;

## Gaze of the S.A.G.E.

The **S.A.G.E.** will always be; 

* Decentralized \(Core Software\)
* Autonomous
* Open-Source
* Distributed

 We do not believe in the suppression of ideas and talents. This system aims to prevent these types of issues in our society. There is no amount of money, status or privilege that would change our values and morals backing this project.
