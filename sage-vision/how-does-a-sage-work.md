# How does a S.A.G.E. work?

## Decentralized Autonomous Verifiable Distribution of Ideas

* Open-source decentralized platform \(Submission based\)
* Educational smart contracts \(Smart agreements\)
* Specified criteria delivered by either a verified institution or a mentor \(Contributors\)
* Curriculum hosting \(Individually provided\)
* Collaborative brainstorming \(Global network of participants\)
* Publicly Accessible \(Initial internet connection\)
* Distributed via blockchains \(Timestamp, Security/Privacy\)

  
 Educational smart contracts created and directed through the S.A.G.E. provide an on-ramp for individuals to obtain a personal credential. Personal credits deposited to an 'account' or 'wallet' outline a transparent, verifiable possession of an educational asset issued from a reputable source. Each received credit is unique to an individual's identity by being intrinsically paired with the public key of the student. Individual public keys correspond to private keys originating from their linked credential account, establishing proof of commitment.  
  
 A proof of knowledge established with each full credential guarantees an individual has learned the criteria outlined in the original educational contract. Educational smart contracts allow learners to have more freedom and control of their schooling and academic exposure. A student can mitigate the risk associated with an investment made in education by having a smart contract operating under parameters within their best interest. Not the benefit of an institution.  


### Freedom to Think + A Guarantee of Recognition

* **Smart Contracts**— Automated 'smart' agreements, enforced, settled and distributed without the need to trust a third party. \(Security flaw/Centralization point\) 
* I**nformative System**— An information system has four components: - Task\(s\) - People - Structure/Roles - Technology  These components deal with the structure and organization of information within a network/system. \(Operations, Managing, Decision Making\)
