## Decentralized Educational Applications

1. Allow individuals to choose the paths in which they want to pursue.  
2. Allow for teachers and institutes to offer their own versions of teaching through [smart contracts](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Smart_contract). 
3. Categorize institutes and teachers by teaching type, ability/skills and rank/prestige. 
4. Community influence on the reputation and viability of an institution, individual mentor or peer-group. 
5. Highlight the reasonings for pursuing a branch of education and credentialism. 
6. Showcase advantages of knowing specific topics, the connections between knowledge, skill-sets and real-world applications. 
7. Display or allow an individual access to relevant statistics and information related to credentials and career paths.

### Educational Smart Contracts

{% hint style="info" %}
Definition; Educational smart contractsâ€” _Automated 'smart' contracts with educational/academic based parameters; presented by one party and agreed to by another.   
  
 Deployed via blockchain\(s\) & propagated within a peer-to-peer style network. Educators in the form of a Verified Academic Mentor or a Verified Academic Institution\(Grouping of Mentors\) form one half of an agreement with other mentors/institutions or individuals/learners._

_For more information about academic contributors see;_ 

* \_\_[_Verified Academic Institution\(V.A.I.\)_](../vai.md)\_\_
* \_\_[_Verified Academic Mentor\(V.A.M.\)_](../vam.md)\_\_
{% endhint %}

 Peers deploying educational based smart contracts are academic mentors or institutions that carry verified academic credentials. Each mentor and institution carries a 'trust/honesty' rating. 

 This rating signifies the reliability and trustworthiness of an individual within the SAGE network by determining the number of outstanding contracts issued 'unverified or unconfirmed transactions/contributions' versus the number of completed contracts or 'verified or confirmed contributions/transactions' to the network whole.

 Educational smart contracts contain preconceived parameters established, clearly and concisely around the topic and ideas presented in the contract before agreement.

 Avoiding misinterpretation or miscommunication resulting in wasted effort, delearning or negative consequences such as; 

* Loss of motivation
* Forgetfulness 
* Regression of ideas 
* Less Understanding 
* Confusion

 Educational smart contracts allow learners to take control. Allowing a proper agreement to take place around what they want to learn, provides choices that would otherwise be impulsive or ignorant, as well as providing a basis to narrow down issues that may occur during the process of learning a new subject or topic. 

 Instead of overlooking fundamental indicators of a student's educational health such as; low grades, minimal attendance/lack of attention, lack of contributions & general questions. With SAGE, an individual's submissions receive recognition for their efforts & conclusions.

### The Benefits of Educational Smart Contracts

* Educational smart contracts allow learners to take control and 'broadcast' an answer to a question asked by multiple teachers  
* Individual submissions receive recognition for their efforts & conclusions 
* Individual learners are rewarded in the form of personal credentials or non-fungible tokens 
* Individual mentors are rewarded in the form of academic tokens or fungible tokens 
* Bias tendencies, perceptual differences, centralized ideas\(groupthink\), closed-source points of view and established narratives face reduction and a substantial decrease in influence on pre-existing educational systems 
* A competitive environment that fosters the sharing of knowledge and the teaching of each other for the betterment of one another 
* Similar to the idea of no kid left behind, but instead, no-one gets ahead if someone's behind.  
* An enforced consequence on negative actions involving the ignorance of ideas, dishonest submissions and insincere answers/suggestions
