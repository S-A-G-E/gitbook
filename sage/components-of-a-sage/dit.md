# D.I.T.'S & L.E.'SðŸ’»ðŸ“š

## Making Learning Interactive

 A D.I.T is a digital interactive textbook, accessible through the internet, stored on a blockchain, downloadable from a server or propagated through a network of peers. As long as it is digital, informative and interactive, then it could stand to be a D.I.T.  
  
Frequent updates made to a D.I.T. make it ideal for today's learners and tomorrow's achievers.   
  
 Currently, the ~~Idiot~~&lt;Knowledge D.I.T. is in a preliminary stage. We encourage feedback, being an open-source project, all honest help is welcome.

### Simulated Learning Environments

 Difficult and relevant subjects rendered through simulated environments and interactives help individuals understand the intricacies of complex systems. A picture is worth a thousand wordsâ€” that says a ton about the value in virtual environments focused on education & learning.

 A picture is worth so many words, because by looking at an image, a majority of what needs explaining, does not. You can look at a picture of a banana in a bowl on a table. That sentence itself does not explain the various nuances that are more than likely present in the photo like other fruits, furniture, potential people etc.

 If that is the case of an image, what is the case of a simulated learning environment or virtual/augmented reality designed to teach and engage an individual in everything from self-discovery to discovery itself?

### Learning & Teaching Advantages of VR/AR

* Create dynamic connections on a global scale
* Augment and adjust learning environments on an individual basis
* Find learning curves and disadvantaged learners easier and with efficiency
* Reduce the burden on a student/learner to find motivation in studying and paying attention
* Simulated environments catering to an individuals preferences & abilities such as; - Language\(s\) - Interests - Skill/Comprehension level\(s\) - Schedule/Availability - Peer group\(s\) - Learning Styles 
* Connecting more teachers to more students and vice versa
* Allowing educators & learners more freedom around the times they teach or learn
* Focusing on harder subjects or more complex topics that are harder to understand without visuals

## D.I.T.'s Compared to Modern Textbooks 

### Digital Interactive Textbook Pro's

* Pro- All of our information catalogued.
* Pro- Downloadable/Print on demand, savable text.
* Pro- Assignments, information accessible via USB or cloud.
* Pro- Little-no cost to update, open-source for global access.
* Pro- Searchable & high-level categorization.

### Digital Interactive Textbook Con's

* Con- Digital only.
* Con- Loss of data, content misplaced.
* Con- No internet means no updated content.
* Con- With no contributors, the content lacks updates.

### Modern Textbook Pro's

* Pro- Full of knowledge and valuable information.
* Pro- Material is sourced & somewhat easy to find.
* Pro- Learners can find what they need.
* Pro- Widely accepted as a useful learning tool.

### Modern Textbook Con's

* Con- Text is often dense making it harder to absorb.
* Con- With detail comes more weight; textbooks are heavy.
* Con- All don't learn the same, textbooks aren't universal.
* Con- Updated infrequently because of cost.

  
 The benefits of an open-source digital textbook are profound. Infographics, videos and interactive simulations allow for a broad approach to learning new concepts. Acknowledging any individual, advocating knowledge, and the benefits of learning something new, empowering skill discovery using non-bias technological platforms.

 Uniting cultures and countries around the world are critical in creating a purely informed system, capable of breaking essential boundaries perpetuated by bias tendencies.
