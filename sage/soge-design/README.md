# IntroductionüóÇÔ∏è

##  Miscommunication & Disorganization

 A standard educational curriculum does not encompass enough nuances and differences on an individual level for both students and teachers.

Some limits of current educational models are;

* Educational programs & teaching styles have troubles spanning borders‚Äî \*both international & national\*
* Current systems cannot handle the influx of innovation\(s\) & students
*  Subtleties in learning and interpretation of subject matter or criteria
*  Non-fluid systems cannot transfer information between each other, in a verifiable and agreeable manner‚Äî  \*privacy and security issues\*
* Multiple different systems for education and numerous styles but no platform to connect them all

The idea of a S.A.G.E. is to provide a practical on-ramp for any school or individual to establish themselves as educated, skilled or prestigious. To create educational smart contracts that can be issued by anyone or any group. An oracle for the fair exchange of information.

## The Goal

### A Fair Exchange of Information

 Our concept‚Äî establish a system to facilitate the fair exchange of information so that no one student, teacher or institution benefits from the abuse or manipulation of information. Any cheating or gaming of the system in a destructive manner would affect all users and contributors to the ecosystem as a whole, equally. Without mass collusion, the system remains decentralized.   
  
 The community always possesses control of the core software. Centralization may occur within an established offshoot of the core software‚Äî mainly within the ecosystem of a group of collaborating mentors\(Which form an institution like entity\).

 If aggressive centralization were to occur, any person could establish a brand new system as a whole and begin adding new network participants separate from the original network.

### Organized, Distributed & Verifiable Approaches to Education

 A S.A.G.E. is designed with distributed file systems, smart contracts and blockchain technology. It is intended to be dynamic and ever-changing. Some of the technologies/ideas that are being considered within this system are;

* Distributed/Clustered File System\(s\) \(**File storage & Distribution**\)
* Blockchain\(s\) \(**Secure verifiable information**\)
* Peer-to-Peer Network\(s\) \(**Propagation**\)
* Decentralized and Centralized Participants/Contributors \(**Contributors**\)

### Proving Knowledge/Skills with Smart Contracts

 A S.A.G.E. system would use a distinct 'proof of knowledge' method determined through an educational-based smart contract provided by a verified academic mentor or institution.  
  
Smart contracts provide a basis to outline the parameters such as;

* Price of time \(of mentor/professional academic\)
* Cost of material knowledge\(if any\)
* Costs related to campus-based fieldwork or facility usage\(if any\)
*  Time-frame\(if established\)
*  Amount of work involved\(tools required, prerequisites\)
* Submission Styles\(formal, informal or other acceptable conditions\)
* Processes of delivering non-transferable credentials\(when complete\) to the contributor\(s\)
* Processes for automating payments to mentors/institutions by releasing escrowed funds to verifiable parties involved

 An academic profile or an identification number linked to each contributor establishes a clear origin of unique submissions received by individuals.
