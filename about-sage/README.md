## Vision & Project Summary\(s\)

 A global network of organized, secure and verifiable information creates a convenient method for educational based processes to be distributed, safe & practical.

 We are working on an open-source and decentralized educational project. Many levels of inputs are acceptable. But the core values will not be changed by outsider opinions/influences. We do not believe in the suppression of ideas and talents. This system aims to prevent these types of issues in our society.

### System of Global Education

#### Distributing Information

 A S.A.G.E. is merely an autonomous conveyor of information, as well as processes with built-in functions that automate the execution of educational-based smart contracts.

 Similar to a D.A.O. \(Decentralized Autonomous Organization\) with the difference being the S.A.G.E. is partially a D.A.C \(Decentralized Autonomous Community\) or a D.A.S. \(Decentralized Autonomous Society\) with no shareholders without community members or no shareholders at all and a large portion of the exchange of value taking place between independent but connected individuals.

#### Fair Value Transactions

 A rice for rice or apples for apple style of exchange. Where no one party is better off than any other party without a sacrifice equally to the whole. Leading to an economic and psychological incentive to keep the machine running and functioning as intended, so that no-one suffers, because if one suffers we all suffer.

 By owning credentials, you have more skills. Any payments must be locked in escrow before a credential is received. By providing valid submissions or 'proofs of knowledge,' an individual can work their way to earning a credential, and escrowed funds are released to teachers after the credentials have been issued to the students.

 The structure of payment is up for negotiation between students, teachers and institutions. Giving equal opportunity and the chance for knowledge to be provided and received by anyone.

#### Democracy & Competitive Evaluations

 The community establishes trustworthiness, and the intrinsic value of an individual's contributions is susceptible to the entire network of contributors. Instead of inherent value given to status, power and privilegeâ€” which is surrounded by an unlimited amount of money or influence and is corruptible.

**SAGE**â€” _Also a network of voters contributing towards each others success, with each vote._ 

\*Votes are metaphors for settled contracts, as each contract acts as both a rank increaser or decreaser\*

ie;   
1 settled/closed contract= valid vote â‰ˆ rank\(+\)increase  
1 unsettled/open contract= invalid vote â‰ˆ rank\(-\)decrease
{% endhint %}

 Viable and robust institutions or individuals must compete with one another to maintain their rank within the network and amongst their peers. With S.A.G.E. enforcing fairness through the settlement and negotiation of smart contracts, a healthy competition between peers can take place without provoking cheating and unfairness. Autonomy allows any individual or grouping of individuals the right to rise within the ranks of the S.A.G.E. & its network of participants.
