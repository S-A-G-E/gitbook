## Frequently Asked Questions

## Question's about S.A.G.E.

### You don't think that a system can work this way...do you?

That's a tough question but thankfully, our team is on it. Please bear with us while we're investigating.

### This system needs teachers & students to work together and agree about everything. This will never work.

Au contraire, it works for whomever needs it.   
  
The S.A.G.E. works as an exchange of values system. S.A.G.E. itself does not choose what is fair and what isn't, it indirectly makes the assumption that all is fair unless it is not.   
  
If it is _**unfair**_ the system responds accordingly and rebalances to find the _optimal amount of fairness_.

### Is it accessible without an internet connection?

Yes, after a few months we finally found the answer. Sadly, Mike is on vacations right now so I'm afraid we are not able to provide the answer at this point.

## Questions about D.I.T.

### Who has access to a Digital textbook?

-

### Who can make a D.I.T.?

 Anyone. Individuals or groups, or anyone who wants to teach or spread knowledge, can create a digital interactive textbook. The idea of a D.I.T. is to harness the power of modern technology to create interactive learning tools for students and individuals to empower themselves and learn new subjects and skills.

D.I.T.'s can be programmable, distributed, decentralized, open-source. Because a D.I.T. is digital, it's incredibly versatile compared to traditional textbooks and other learning tools. D.I.T.'s integrated with Virtual/Augmented realities, learning engines, and other educational apps allow for smooth transitions between schools, courses/subjects for both teachers and learners.
