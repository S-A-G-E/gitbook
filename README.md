# System of Autonomous Global Education \(S.A.G.E.\)📚🏫

## A Modern Dilemma

 Currently, the pressure is placed on students to make the appropriate decision not only regarding their education but also the risk associated with making a large purchase and investment in the future. With uncertain conditions and fluctuating economic factors, it becomes apparent relatively quickly that it is nearly impossible to make such a significant investment and obtain the necessary profits or gains afterwards, resulting in a lack of proper return on the initial investment.   
  
 Over time this causes a significant deterioration to our social/educational systems– this ripples further into the economics of society and the integrity of its structure. A **S.A.G.E.** is needed to help distribute information effectively on a global scale and allow for transparent delivery of credentials to individuals. Providing recognition of individual skills & efforts.

### Extinct in the Wild: Philosopher Kings & Queens

  If Plato were alive today, he'd agree if philosopher-kings & queens have ever been present on earth, we could classify them as extinct in the wild or a nearly extinct species. 

 In [Plato's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato) terms, a philosopher-king or queen is a leader who loves wisdom— motivated pursuit of knowledge. We lack these types of leaders who make ample time and have enough consideration to make accurate decisions.

 Plato's leaders also possess intellect, honesty/reliability and a willingness to live a simplistic experience. 

> "Philosophers \[must\] become kings\(leaders\)…or those now called kings\(leaders\) \[must\]…genuinely and adequately philosophize" 
>
> -Plato; [The Republic](https://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Republic_of_Plato.html?id=uqcNAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) — \[5.473d\]-

 We are already on the path as a society towards changing towards a properly decentralized and open community of trustworthy interaction. In essence, the plan for the S.A.G.E. is to boost our productivity as a whole, allowing every person to establish themselves as honest, reliable, intellectual and skillful. Under these conditions, the Philosopher King's & Queen's— will be formed.
